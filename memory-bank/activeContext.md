# Active Context: Current Development Focus
          
## Current Development Focus
          As of May 2025, development is concentrated on the following components:
          1. **Optimization Engine Refinement**
             - Defining all the constraints to respect business need
	     -  Modifying the objective function to take into account all the edge cases : in order to allocate best products in best channels, we need to have a ranking of the product & a ranking of the channel in this function

          2. **User Interface Enhancements**
             - Redesigning the results visualization dashboard
             - Adding drag-and-drop functionality for manual adjustments
             - Implementing user preference saving
          3. **Understanding of the allocation**
	     - We should be able to see the input parameters of the problem in the output so that we can know how the allocation has been made
	     - We should be able to see which constraints have been applied and how to see the limiting factors and understand the logic of the program
	     - We be able to see the impact of some parameter or some constraint on the optimality of the solutions.
          
## Recent Changes and Decisions
          - Testing cases written
	  - Logger added with warning, info, debug and critical
	  - Taking into account input parameters and input data in the problem
                    
## Learnings from User Testing
          - Users prefer tabular views with sorting/filtering over purely graphical representations
          - The ability to save and compare multiple scenarios is highly valued
          - Manual override capabilities are essential for handling business exceptions
          - Users need clear explanations of why specific allocations were recommended
          - Export to Excel functionality is critical for integration with existing workflows)
